# RiseUP PWA Installation Guide

## "Home Screen Layout Locked" Error

If you see "Cannot add RiseUP, home screen layout locked" when trying to install the app, this means your phone's home screen is full or locked. Here are solutions:

### Solution 1: Free Up Home Screen Space (Recommended)
1. **Remove or reorganize apps on your home screen**
   - Long-press any app on your home screen
   - Move some apps to other pages or into folders
   - Create at least one empty spot on your home screen
   
2. **Try installing again**
   - Open Chrome/Safari and go to the RiseUP website
   - Tap the menu (3 dots) → "Add to Home screen"
   - Tap "Add"

### Solution 2: Unlock Home Screen Layout (Samsung/Android)
1. Long-press empty space on your home screen
2. Tap "Home screen settings"
3. Disable "Lock Home screen layout" if it's enabled
4. Try installing the app again

### Solution 3: Install to App Drawer (Android)
Instead of home screen, the app goes directly to your app drawer:
1. In Chrome, open the RiseUP website
2. Tap menu (3 dots) → "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"
3. On some phones, this adds to the app drawer automatically
4. Find "RiseUP" in your app list

### Solution 4: Create Bookmark (Fallback)
If installation still fails:
1. Open the site in your browser
2. Tap the "Share" button (iOS) or menu (Android)
3. Select "Add to Home screen" or "Add bookmark"
4. The website will work like an app even as a bookmark

### Solution 5: Different Launcher (Advanced - Android)
If using a custom launcher that locks the layout:
1. Switch to a different launcher temporarily
2. Install the RiseUP app
3. Switch back to your preferred launcher
4. The app will remain installed

## Browser-Specific Installation

### Chrome (Android)
1. Visit the RiseUP website
2. Look for the "Install" banner at the bottom
3. Tap "Install"
4. Or use menu → "Install app"
